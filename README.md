# DAND - Identify Enron Fraud

The exploration of data was done primarily in `notebooks/Exploration.ipynb`. The report is in `REPORT.md` file. The final source code is in `poi_id.py`, and the models that it saved have been committed to the repository.

I've verified that `tester.py` runs successfully in the repo. I had to alter the path to `tools` folder.
